/**
 * There are N cities numbered from 1 to N.
 *
 * You are given connections, where each connections[i] = [city1, city2, cost] represents the cost to connect city1 and city2 together. (A connection is bidirectional: connecting city1 and city2 is the same as connecting city2 and city1.)
 *
 * Return the minimum cost so that for every pair of cities, there exists a path of connections (possibly of length 1) that connects those two cities together. The cost is the sum of the connection costs used. If the task is impossible, return -1.
 *
 * Input: N = 3, connections = [[1,2,5],[1,3,6],[2,3,1]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation:
 * Choosing any 2 edges will connect all cities so we choose the minimum 2.
 *
 * Input: N = 4, connections = [[1,2,3],[3,4,4]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation:
 * There is no way to connect all cities even if all edges are used.
 *
 * 用到了最小生成树算法 Kruskal 算法, 具体方法是每次选出最低cost的边, 如果两顶点并不连通, 则cost加入最终答案且同时连通这两个顶点.
